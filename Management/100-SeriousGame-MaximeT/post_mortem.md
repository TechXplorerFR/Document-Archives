## Key Achievements

- Successfully integrated the card-based and application-based parts of the game for a cohesive experience.
- Clear and efficient organization of Git & GitHub repositories.
- Created visually appealing and high-quality game cards.
- Delivered a fully playable game.

## Challenges

- Limited project time posed a significant challenge.
- The design process was time-consuming, and finding the right ideas for implementation was difficult.
- Identifying which climate change-related topics to focus on was a major hurdle.
- The client’s expectations were vague and insufficiently defined.
- Managing human resources, including maintaining team morale and efficiency, was challenging.

## Root Causes

- The allocated project time was too short; we should have planned a smaller game or committed to more work outside of school hours.
- Lack of attentive listening led to misunderstandings that impacted the project later on.
- Issues in task organization, tracking, and communication among team members and with the client.

## Lessons Learned

- Greater curiosity about the project topic is essential, including maintaining better and more frequent communication with the client.
- Presentations should be aligned with Franck’s feedback to improve their quality.
- Regularly reevaluate and question decisions to ensure alignment with project goals and requirements.
- Testing is critical and should include users outside the school to gain diverse feedback.
- Each team member should learn from their own tasks, roles, and mistakes as well as those of other team members.

## Conclusion

This project was a valuable learning experience for all of us. The mistakes we made and the challenges we faced will serve as stepping stones for future projects, enabling us to improve and succeed in our endeavors.
